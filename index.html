            <p>Throughout the redesigning of Hot Rhythm Holiday it was a very rough start for myself. I was overwhelmed by the technological aspects of the class. I could get through readings and discussions just fine. However, I feel like I didn't do enough for the project even though I did what I was told to do by my group members. I participated throughout my group's meetings on what we should do for Hot Rhythm Holiday and how we should condense all the pages to meet the requirements for AIR. I figured out how to add the text over the pictures on WordPress, it's such a small thing but I think it made a difference amongst all the pages. My pages I needed to do were the FAQ page and Donation page. The Donation page didn't meet the cut-off for the amount of pages we needed for the AIR competition so it ended up as a donation button instead. I also did the venue page, however, that didn't meet the cut-off either and had to be combined with another page. I also made sure to add alt text for all my images on the pages I was in charge of. Lastly, I made sure to edit the code for the Schedule page. This was the bulk of what I did throughout the redesigning of the website. I didn't handle emails like Sophia or Daniel. I do want to mention that Sophia was the one who took the most charge for the project and was able to efficiently organize how the website will be and always made sure to ask questions within the group.</p>

            <p>So, I don't think I had the most enjoyable experience. Personally, redesigning websites is not my thing. It was interesting to see and work through, I just preferred reading and discussions on accessibility with technology. Yet, that's not what all of the class is supposed to be about. I viewed redesigning the website as getting an insider look into how difficult these websites are to navigate for those who have disabilities.</p>

            <p>I don't think I had a huge strength throughout this project. I think maybe I was good about making sure I completed my parts of the project. Even when there were issues arising in my personal life, I always made sure to get the work done. I do think researching how to add certain things to the website, like how to add plugins or adjust them, was also something I had down.</p>
            <p>My biggest weakness was probably coding. I would get really frustrated and overwhelmed with coding. It's just so daunting to me and I would frequently have to take breaks when adjusting the code to make sure it was in check with the accessibility. WordPress also was stressful to use and get the hang of. Eventually, at a snail's pace, I was able to figure things out.</p>

            <p>Accessibility can change the trajectory of the internet. This will allow those with disabilities to be able to navigate the internet and experience services, be informed, and interact with others through electronic devices that were supposed to make everyone's daily lives easier. Instead, without accessibility, there are more barriers than before for those with disabilities. Accessibility opens a whole new door and gives the same opportunities to those without disabilities.</p>
